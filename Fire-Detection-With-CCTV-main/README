# FIRE DETECTION WITH SURVEILLANCE CAMERA USING OPEN SOURCE COMPUTER VISION
# Description
    The purpose of the project is to solve the existing problem of unreliable
fire detection systems used in industrial warehouses. The project is aimed at
using surveillance cameras in order to detect and monitor the occurrence of fire.
Since the cameras are already installed in places, this system is aimed at
diminishing the disadvantages of false alarm, making the system cost effective
and a fast method of detecting fire. The system uses Open Source Computer
Vision, also known as OpenCV, is an open source freeware which is aimed at
computer vision.
