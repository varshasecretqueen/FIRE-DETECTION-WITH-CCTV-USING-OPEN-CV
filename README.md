  *  As part of my coursework in computer science, I worked on a project to develop a fire detection system using surveillance camera and OpenCV. 
The goal was to create an efficient and accurate method for detecting fires in real-time from camera footage. The main challenge was designing an 
algorithm that could reliably identify signs of fire such as flames and smoke while minimizing false positives.
  *  My task was to design and implement the fire detection algorithm using OpenCV. This involved working on both the detection logic and the
 integration with video feeds from surveillance cameras.
  *  implemented an algorithm in Python using OpenCV to process the video feeds and detect potential fires. I tested the system extensively using
various video sources to optimize the parameters for fire detection. I also set up notifications to alert the user when a potential fire was detected.
  *  The fire detection system I developed successfully detected fires in real-time during testing, providing reliable alerts when fire was present.
this experience enhanced my understanding of computer vision and real-time processing. The project received positive feedback from my instructors for
its innovative approach and effectiveness.
